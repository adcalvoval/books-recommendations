## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Styling:** CSS3 with Flexbox/Grid
- **Storage:** Browser localStorage
- **APIs:** Open Library, Google Books API, Anthropic Claude (via a Vercel serverless function)
- **Book Data:** Goodreads-compatible CSV format

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adcalvoval/book-recommendations.git
cd book-recommendations
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. (Optional, for AI-powered recommendations) Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Claude API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Without this, search recommendations fall back to keyword-based Google Books search automatically.

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The `/api/recommendations` and `/api/health` routes only run under Vercel's dev server, not plain Vite. To test them locally, run `npx vercel dev` instead (first run `npx vercel link` to connect the project, then set `CLAUDE_API_KEY` via `npx vercel env pull` or the Vercel dashboard).

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port `vercel dev` reports).

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be available in the `dist/` directory.

## Usage
